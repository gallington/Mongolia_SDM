Notes for Ginger

`new.obs.exp.R`

# Figure 3

* added superscripts to axis title and annotations
* should r for r-squared be capitalized? 
* should x axes have consistent years so they line up?

# Figure 4

* moved panel labels to cowplot
* changed y tick labels to be div by 10^6 
* adjusted y position of c and d labels to slightly above 0.5 (0.525). not sure what looks best
* maybe get rid of "year" x label on top two panels 
* separated the commands to save plot into fig4.R, commented out in newUFfigs.R file (now source that file to update individual panels)
* put legend at bottom. control size of legend with the rel_heights argument

* is year as xlab redundant? 
* gridlines? 
* how are annotations? should they maybe go in the y axis label? 
* too big a space between bottom and legend? 
* the line width and plotting character size within the panels might help distinguish the scenarios?

# Figure 5

* similar changes as fig 4
# Figure 6

* combined with plot grid
* figure coloring with as.factor in first ggplot aes
* legend tweaking done in fig6.R get_legend
* adjusted ylim on biomass top plot so it didn't look like it was hanging over the top
* Should ylims on top and bottom plots be the same to facilitate comparison??
