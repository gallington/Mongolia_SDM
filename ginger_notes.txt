Notes for Ginger

`new.obs.exp.R`

# Figure 3

* added superscripts to axis title and annotations
* should r for r-squared be capitalized? 
* should x axes have consistent years so they line up?

# Figure 4

* moved panel labels to cowplot
* changed y tick labels to be div by 10^6 
* adjusted y position of c and d labels to slightly above 0.5 (0.525). not sure what looks best
* maybe get rid of "year" x label on top two panels 
* separated the commands to save plot into fig4.R, commented out in newUFfigs.R file (now source that file to update individual panels)

* put legend at bottom. control size of legend with the rel_heights argument

* put 4 panels vertical as a 4x1
