This repository contains the code to process model outputs and produce figures for the manuscript:

Allington, G.R.H., W. Li, and D.G. Brown. (2017) Urbanization and environmental policy effect on the future availability of grazing resources on the Mongolian Plateau: modeling socio-environmental system dynamics. Environmental Science and Policy 68: 35-46.

Model outpts from Vensim models are in the /data folder 
Vensim model files in /vensim_model folder

Step 1: data.prep.R
Step 2: new.obs.exp.R
Step 3: create subplots w UFfigs_for_pub.R
Step 4: combine & export w/ fig4.R, fig5.R, fig6.R

See manuscript for explanations of model structure and equations and individual Scenarios.
